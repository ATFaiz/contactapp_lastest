# contactapp
During this project, I created a Laravel contact application and thoroughly documented the process in a blog post. I provided an overview of the development environment utilized and briefly introduced Laravel and its associated tools. Additionally, I explained the steps involved in creating the Laravel project and incorporating the Laravel/ui package, along with bootstrap scaffolding for the frontend. I also included concise descriptions of significant topics such as authentication, authorization, eloquent ORM, model, middleware, blades, and routing, highlighting their relevance and implementation within the project.

Apart from implementing authentication, I employed various methods of authorization, including Gate and middleware, specifically applying authorization in the CRUD methods within the ContactController. The project was connected to a database via the .env file, and I created corresponding models for the users and contacts tables. Furthermore, I defined the table fields and their properties through migrations. To ensure clarity, I extensively explained most methods, helpers, and functions used throughout the project, encompassing their usage in controllers, blades, and other relevant areas.
